# VacancySearch

VacancySearch is a private Django project that processes job vacancies using AI, detects duplicate postings, and integrates with Telegram for real-time job updates. The project uses Django with a REST API, Celery for background processing, and OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT for analyzing vacancy data.

## Features

- **Vacancy Processing:** Extracts and analyzes job vacancy details using a ChatGPT prompt.
- **Duplicate Detection:** Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to avoid duplicate job entries.
- **REST API:** Exposes endpoints for creating vacancies.
- **Background Tasks:** Processes vacancies in batches with Celery.
- **Telegram Integration:** A Telethon-based bot collects job posts from groups/channels and sends them to the API.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Uses Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Redis for easy setup.
